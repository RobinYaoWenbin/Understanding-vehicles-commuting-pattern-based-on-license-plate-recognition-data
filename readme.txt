The repo is the source code of the paper "Understanding vehicles commuting pattern based on license plate recognition data".
The specific research content can be found in the article, and the implementation is mainly using python and sql.
The source code of part of the content in discusion has been deleted, because the code is basically duplicated. Only the threshold for identifying the morning and evening peaks has been modified, or random sampling has been done again.
A lot of content in the code is for research considerations, so a lot of analysis has been done, but for engineering, these are unnecessary. Therefor, for engineering, this algorithm can be implemented with more concise code after reading the article. So I suggest that if it is for learning, it is worth reading the source code carefully. But if it is for engineering, you can re-implement the algorithm after reading the article, which will save time for you.
Last, I must remind that this is my first complete project. The code may be a bit naive, but do not allow to laugh at me. I guarantee that the next open source project will be more mature. Just a joke.
